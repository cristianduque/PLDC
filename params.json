  "body": "### Welcome to PLDC Webpage\r\nPLDC is a programming language that provides an easy format to use for converting polynomials to its Laplace transform. The user inputs a polynomial equation and apply the command “Laplace”, it receives the conversion in terms of t or s domain. Users are also able to print the expressions and their results in the terminal window. We developed PLDC having in mind that our primary users for this language will be Electrical Engineering students, but anyone learning the Laplace transform theory can use this language to their convenience.\r\n\r\n### PLDC Syntax Example\r\n```\r\n//Create expression in t or s domain\r\n    tExpressionName = 2t^4\r\n    sExpressionName = 5s^3+1s\r\n\r\n//Assign result of transform to variable\r\n    result1 = laplace(tExpressionName)\r\n    result2 = laplace(2t^4)\r\n    result3 = laplace(sExpressionName)\r\n    result4 = laplace sExpressionName\r\n    result5 = laplace 5s^2-2s+s\r\n\r\n//Display result in terminal\r\n    show result1\r\n    show (“Result of expression in S domain is: ”, result1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nPLDC was developed by Melvin Vega (@melvinvega) Velcy Palomino (@velcy) and Laura Rivera (@laura-rivera21) for the Programming Languages course at the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez Campus",
